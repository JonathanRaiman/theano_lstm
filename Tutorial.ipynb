There are many different celltypes we can use, but the most common these days (and incidentally most effective) are `RNN` and `LSTM`. For a more in-depth discussion of how these work I suggest checking out [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+lstm/0/1/0/all/0/1), or [Alex Graves' website](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/), or [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short_term_memory).

To add an Embedding we create `Embedding(vocabulary_size, size_of_embedding_vectors)` and insert it at the begging of the `StackedCells`'s layers list (thereby telling `StackedCells` that this Embedding layer needs to be activated before the other ones):\n",

To ensure that our prediction is indeed a probability distribution we \"activate\" our layer with a Softmax, meaning that we will exponentiate every value of the output, $q_i = e^{x_i}$, so that all values are positive, and then we will divide the output by its sum so that the output sums to 1:\n",
